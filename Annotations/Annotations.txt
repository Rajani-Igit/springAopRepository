Annotations are used for provideing the conifugration information of the 
classes to underlying container
(We can say alternative way of providing configuration information)
Annotations are not available in market from starting of the spring release
Later They introduced into it
 In java also Starting point of time it is not availble.from 1.6 onwards
 they introduced it.in order to provide the flexiblity to the programmer
 Before Annotations there are lot of third party libraries are there to provide the
 metadata information to the container
 1)xml editors 
 ** But incase of core java they provided marker interfaces for provideing 
    the meta data information to the underlying container 
 ** If you want serialize a class you have to implement from serialize interface 
    so that jdk will provide that flexibility to the application 
 ** Same way in j2ee applications if we provide thw information in xml file 
    underlying container will manage the application classes
 But there are some disadvantages are there if go for configuration approach
 1)To make you class manage by the container you need to write the more code
 (Minim 8 tags we have to write to configure a servlet inside container) 
 2)We need to leanr different technology (xml file)
 3)Deriving the application is very difficult
 4)There will be no comipliers are available for precheking purposes
 5)There are no IDE support are there like Spring STS
 
 ** Some devlopers raised this conserns about configuration approach
 Later point of time some third party library vendors come up with an annotations 
 then J2EE also provided support of annotations.but in one shot they did not provided 
 every thing.it is incremental support
 **There are advantages of annotaions are also there
 1)These are single words only no need to write line of code 
 2) we no need to learn different technology.Bcz it is implemented in java 
 3)Deriving the application is easy bcz insource code it self we are writing the every thing
 4)When we writing the source code itself it will compile so we no need to do anyserver restarts
 5)There are lot of IDE Supports are there.We no need to learn different technology
 bcz these are normal java classes only
 
 **But after few days while working annotations some people raised their conserns about
 working with annotations
 ** There will be some disadvantages are the with annotations and some advantages are 
 with xml configuration file
 
 **In production environment there are coflicting roles between devloper and deployer
 Bcz always devlopers will devlop the application in devlopment environmrnt
 
 ** BUt deployer has to change the configaration information it will be deficut for 
 him to modify the java code
 
 ** For this sun people provided the solution what ever you want if you provide 
 configration file it will take it from there it will supress the annotations over 
 configration
 
 ** annotations will not makes our classes as pozofied classes.bcz we need to implement from some classes
 or interfaces if these are not available at run time our application is in not in a state
 where it will not run
 
 ** For this Sun people provided some Retention Policy so up to where this annotation 
 you want to apply you can specify the policy level there
 
 ** In XMl file approach at one shot every information is available about the application
 ** In Case of entireprise application devlopment it is highly recommended to go for 
 xml file 
 ** And every one in our project follows best design and knowing about the syntaxes
 and semantics of xml we can happily work with xml configuration approach
 ** In case of normal or simple application devlopment we have to use annotations 
 
 ** incase of you dont have any source code with you (i.e third party libraries) in this case we can not 
 use annotations 
 **And if you want to create more than one bean defination to a class we can not acheive by annotations 
 ** We can do by xml approach.but there are several problems are there if we go for
 xml file
 ** In that situations we can devlop those by using configuration approach by writing a class and configuring
 remaing classes as beans in side thae class
 and we can give this class to IOC container to make these classes as beans
